# Angular + Capacitor AI Plugin Skeleton

This Angular project is a **skeleton for testing my own custom Capacitor plugin**. The plugin uses the device camera to take a photo, analyzes it, and allows manipulation of colors — for example, changing black to white.  

The goal is to experiment with AI-powered image processing directly on mobile devices, useful for:

- Design apps  
- Clothing stores (preview color changes)  
- Just for fun and experimentation  

## Features

- Angular front-end  
- Capacitor integration for iOS and Android  
- Camera access via Capacitor  
- Custom AI plugin for color detection and manipulation
